 # Svelte with Sapper Boilerplate

## Getting started
`git clone https://github.com/KrishSkywalker/sapperTemplate`


### Running the project

Once you have created the project, install dependencies and run the project in development mode:

```bash
cd my-app
npm install
npm run dev
```

This will start the development server on [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000). Open it and click around.

You now have a fully functional Sapper project! To get started developing, consult [sapper.svelte.dev](https://sapper.svelte.dev).

## Directory structure

Sapper expects to find two directories in the root of your project ‚Äî  `src` and `static`.


### src

The [src](src) directory contains the entry points for your app ‚Äî `client.js`, `server.js` and (optionally) a `service-worker.js` ‚Äî along with a `template.html` file and a `routes` directory.


#### src/routes

This is the heart of your Sapper app. There are two kinds of routes ‚Äî *pages*, and *server routes*.

**Pages** are Svelte components written in `.svelte` files. When a user first visits the application, they will be served a server-rendered version of the route in question, plus some JavaScript that 'hydrates' the page and initialises a client-side router. From that point forward, navigating to other pages is handled entirely on the client for a fast, app-like feel. (Sapper will preload and cache the code for these subsequent pages, so that navigation is instantaneous.)

**Server routes** are modules written in `.js` files, that export functions corresponding to HTTP methods. Each function receives Express `request` and `response` objects as arguments, plus a `next` function. This is useful for creating a JSON API, for example.

There are three simple rules for naming the files that define your routes:

* A file called `src/routes/about.svelte` corresponds to the `/about` route. A file called `src/routes/blog/[slug].svelte` corresponds to the `/blog/:slug` route, in which case `params.slug` is available to the route
* The file `src/routes/index.svelte` (or `src/routes/index.js`) corresponds to the root of your app. `src/routes/about/index.svelte` is treated the same as `src/routes/about.svelte`.
* Files and directories with a leading underscore do *not* create routes. This allows you to colocate helper modules and components with the routes that depend on them ‚Äî for example you could have a file called `src/routes/_helpers/datetime.js` and it would *not* create a `/_helpers/datetime` route.


#### src/node_modules/images

Images added to `src/node_modules/images` can be imported into your code using `import 'images/<filename>'`. They will be given a dynamically generated filename containing a hash, allowing for efficient caching and serving the images on a CDN.

See [`index.svelte`](src/routes/index.svelte) for an example.


#### src/node_modules/@sapper

This directory is managed by Sapper and generated when building. It contains all the code you import from `@sapper` modules.


### static

The [static](static) directory contains static assets that should be served publicly. Files in this directory will be available directly under the root URL, e.g. an `image.jpg` will be available as `/image.jpg`.

The default [service-worker.js](src/service-worker.js) will preload and cache these files, by retrieving a list of `files` from the generated manifest:

```js
import { files } from '@sapper/service-worker';
```

If you have static files you do not want to cache, you should exclude them from this list after importing it (and before passing it to `cache.addAll`).

Static files are served using [sirv](https://github.com/lukeed/sirv).


## Production mode and deployment

To start a production version of your app, run `npm run build && npm start`. This will disable live reloading, and activate the appropriate bundler plugins.

You can deploy your application to any environment that supports Node 10 or above. As an example, to deploy to [Vercel Now](https://vercel.com) when using `sapper export`, run these commands:

```bash
npm install -g vercel
vercel
```

If your app can't be exported to a static site, you can use the [now-sapper](https://github.com/thgh/now-sapper) builder. You can find instructions on how to do so in its [README](https://github.com/thgh/now-sapper#basic-usage).

## üìù Important Notes
Make sure that the static folder is not more than 20MB, if it is and you don't need caching, disable `service-worker.js`, however if you need caching, set up a CDN, the best idea is to use Next.JS because it automatically serves all deployed static files through a Vercel CDN.

Use the now-sapper](https://github.com/thgh/now-sapper) builder for exporting to a static site.

Make sure you edit `manifest.json`, `package.json` and the meta tags accordingly, the SEO is already done in `template.html`.

### Now go out there and smash it üëä
